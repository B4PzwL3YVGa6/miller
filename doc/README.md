index.html et al. are autogenerated from content-for-index.html et al. by
http://github.com/johnkerl/poki

Manpage data `mlr.1` is generated by running `ruby mkman.rb > mlr.1`

Neither of these are invoked automatically at package-build time. They do need
to be run after code changes, since they both automatically include Miller
program output within their text. All the resulting .html files, and the mlr.1
file, should be committed to source control.
