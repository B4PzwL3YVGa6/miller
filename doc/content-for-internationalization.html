<p/>Miller handles strings with any characters other than 0x00 or 0xff, using
explicit UTF-8-friendly string-length computations.  (I have no plans to
support UTF-16 or ISO-8859-1.) Tabular output formats (pprint and xtab) are
aligned correctly and the Miller <tt>strlen</tt> function correctly counts
UTF-8 codepoints rather than bytes.  Please file an issue at
<a href="https://github.com/johnkerl/miller">https://github.com/johnkerl/miller</a>
if you encounter bugs related to internationalization (or anything else for
that matter).
