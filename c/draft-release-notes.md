## Features:

* **Comment strings in data files:** `mlr --skip-comments` allows you to
filter out input lines starting with `#`, for all file formats.  Likewise, `mlr
--skip-comments-with X` lets you specify the comment-string `X`.  Comments are
only supported at start of data line.

* The [**count-similar**](http://johnkerl.org/miller-releases/miller-5.3.0/doc/reference-verbs.html#count-similar)
verb lets you compute cluster sizes by cluster labels.

* While Miller DSL arithmetic gracefully overflows from 64-integer to
double-precision float (see also
[**here**](http://johnkerl.org/miller/doc/reference.html#Arithmetic)), there
are now the **integer-preserving arithmetic operators**
[**`.+`**](http://johnkerl.org/miller-releases/miller-5.3.0/doc/reference-dsl.html#.+)
[**`.-`**](http://johnkerl.org/miller-releases/miller-5.3.0/doc/reference-dsl.html#.-)
[**`.*`**](http://johnkerl.org/miller-releases/miller-5.3.0/doc/reference-dsl.html#.*)

[**`.//`**](http://johnkerl.org/miller-releases/miller-5.3.0/doc/reference-dsl.html#.//)
for those times when you want integer overflow.

* There is a new [**bitcount**](http://johnkerl.org/miller-releases/miller-5.3.0/doc/reference-dsl.html#bitcount) function: for example, `echo x=0xf0000206 | mlr put '$y=bitcount($x)'` produces `x=0xf0000206,y=7`.

* [**Issue 158**](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues/158): `mlr -T` is
an alias for `--nidx --fs tab`, and `mlr -t` is an alias for `mlr
--tsvlite`.

* The mathematical constants **&pi; and <i>e</i> have been renamed from `PI` and `E` to `M_PI` and `M_E`, respectively**. (It's annoying to get a syntax error when you try to define a variable named `E` in the DSL, when `A` through `D` work just fine.) This is a backward incompatibility, but not enough of us to justify calling this release Miller 6.0.0.

## Documentation:

* As noted
[**here**](http://johnkerl.org/miller-releases/miller-5.3.0/doc/reference-dsl.html#A_note_on_the_complexity_of_Millerâ€™s_expression_language), while Miller has its own DSL there will always be things better expressible in a general-purpose language. The new page
[**Sharing data with other languages**](http://johnkerl.org/miller-releases/miller-5.3.0/doc/data-sharing.html) shows how to seamlessly share data back and forth between **Miller, Ruby, and Python**.  [**SQL-input examples**](http://johnkerl.org/miller-releases/miller-5.3.0/doc/10-min.html#SQL-input_examples) and [**SQL-output examples**](http://johnkerl.org/miller-releases/miller-5.3.0/doc/10-min.html#SQL-output_examples) contain detailed information the interplay between **Miller and SQL**.

* [**Issue 150**](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues/150) raised a
question about suppressing numeric conversion. This resulted in a new FAQ entry
[**How do I suppress numeric conversion?**](http://johnkerl.org/miller/doc/faq.html#How_do_I_suppress_numeric_conversion?), as well as the
longer-term follow-on [**issue 151**](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues/151) which will make numeric conversion happen on a just-in-time basis.

* To my surprise, **csvlite format options** weren&rsquo;t listed in `mlr --help` or the manpage. This has been fixed.

## Bugfixes:

* [**Issue 159**](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues/159) fixes regex-match of literal dot.

* [**Issue 160**](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues/160) fixes out-of-memory cases for huge files. This is an old bug, as old as Miller, and is due to inadequate testing of huge-file cases. The problem is simple: Miller prefers memory-mapped I/O (using `mmap`) over `stdio` since `mmap` is fractionally faster. Yet as any processing (even `mlr cat`) steps through an input file, more and more pages are faulted in -- and, unfortunately, previous pages are not paged out once memory pressure increases. (This despite gallant attempts with `madvise`.) Once all processing is done, the memory is released; there is no leak per se. But the Miller process can crash before the entire file is read. The solution is equally simple: to prefer `stdio` over `mmap` for files over 4GB in size. (This 4GB threshold is tunable via the `--mmap-below` flag as described in the [manpage](http://johnkerl.org/miller-releases/miller-5.3.0/doc/manpage.html).)

* [**Issue 161**](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues/161) fixes a CSV-parse error (with error message "unwrapped double quote at line 0") when a CSV file starts with the UTF-8 bill-of-materials ("BOM") sequence `0xef` `0xbb` `0xbf` and the header line has double-quoted fields. ([Release 5.2.0](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/releases/tag/v5.2.0) introduced handling for UTF-8 BOMs, but missed the case of double-quoted header line.)

* [**Issue 162**](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues/162) fixes a corner case doing multi-emit of aggregate variables when the first variable name is a typo.
