This is a relatively minor release, containing feature requests and bugfixes while I've been working on the Windows port (which is nearly complete).

* **JSON arrays**: as described (here)[http://johnkerl.org/miller-releases/miller-5.0.0/doc/file-formats.html#Tabular_JSON], Miller being a tabular data processor can't and won't support arbitrary JSON. But as of 5.1.0, arrays are converted to maps with integer keys, which are then at least processable using Miller.

```
--json-map-arrays-on-input    JSON arrays are unmillerable. --json-map-arrays-on-input
--json-skip-arrays-on-input   is the default: arrays are converted to integer-indexed
--json-fatal-arrays-on-input  maps. The other two options cause them to be skipped, or
```

* The [**mlr fraction**](xxx) verb ...

* strptime & strftime w/ fracsec; sec2gmt(x, n) verb & function
  - fractional seconds in strptime (%S) and strftime (latter %nS)
    > minor backward incompatiblity. suggest wrap with `int(...)`.
