This is a relatively minor release, containing feature requests and bugfixes while I've been working on the Windows port (which is nearly complete).

**Features:**
* **JSON arrays**: as described [here](http://johnkerl.org/miller-releases/miller-5.1.0/doc/file-formats.html#Tabular_JSON), Miller being a tabular data processor can't and won't support arbitrary JSON. But as of 5.1.0, arrays are converted to maps with integer keys, which are then at least processable using Miller.

```
--json-map-arrays-on-input    JSON arrays are unmillerable. --json-map-arrays-on-input
--json-skip-arrays-on-input   is the default: arrays are converted to integer-indexed
--json-fatal-arrays-on-input  maps. The other two options cause them to be skipped, or
```

* The new [**mlr fraction**](http://johnkerl.org/miller-releases/miller-5.1.0/doc/reference-verbs.html#fraction) verb makes possible in a few keystrokes what was only possible before using two-pass DSL logic: here you can turn numerical values down a column into their fractional/percentage contribution to column totals, optionally grouped by other key columns.

* The DSL functions
[**strptime**](http://johnkerl.org/miller-releases/miller-5.1.0/doc/reference-dsl.html#strptime) and
[**strftime**](http://johnkerl.org/miller-releases/miller-5.1.0/doc/reference-dsl.html#strftime) DSL functions now
handle fractional seconds. For parsing, use <tt>%S</tt> format as always. The return value from <tt>strptime</tt> is now
floating-point, not integer, which is a minor backward incompatibility not worth labeling this release as 6.0.0. You can
work around this using <tt>int(strptime(...))</tt>.  The DSL functions
[**gmt2sec**](http://johnkerl.org/miller-releases/miller-5.1.0/doc/reference-dsl.html#gmt2sec) and
[**sec2gmt**](http://johnkerl.org/miller-releases/miller-5.1.0/doc/reference-dsl.html#sec2gmt) are keystroke-savers for
<tt>strptime</tt> and <tt>strftime</tt> and are similarly modified, as is the
[**sec2gmt**](http://johnkerl.org/miller-releases/miller-5.1.0/doc/reference-verbs.html#sec2gmt) verb.

* A few nearly-standalone programs -- which do not have anything to do with record streams -- are packed with Miller. <tt>mlr aux-list</tt>. xxx doc-ent.

* The
[**stats1**](http://johnkerl.org/miller-releases/miller-5.1.0/doc/reference-verbs.html#stats1) and
[**merge-fields**](http://johnkerl.org/miller-releases/miller-5.1.0/doc/reference-verbs.html#merge-fields) verbs now support an
**antimode** aggregator, in addition to the existing mode aggregator.

* The
[**join**](http://johnkerl.org/miller-releases/miller-5.1.0/doc/reference-verbs.html#join) verb
does unsorted join by default, with mem caveat. & update dox. incl sjax req# xxx.

* mlr nest --evar , -f items xxx.

**Documentation:**
* xxx feature-counting script
* xxx mlrfunc docsect w/ h2's

**Bugfixes:**
* xxx join bug
* xxx correct JSON escaping on output
